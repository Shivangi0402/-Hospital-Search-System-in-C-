# -Hospital-Search-System-in-C-
I developed a Hospital Search System in C to assist users in finding hospitals based on their preferences.
The program allows users to input the type of hospital they are looking for, along with minimum rating and price per day criteria.  
Hospitals are sorted based on their ratings and prices, and the results are displayed with color-coded ratings for easy identification.
Implemented using C language, the system provides a user-friendly interface for efficiently finding hospitals meeting specific requirements.
